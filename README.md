# assignment-4-packages-and-shiny-apps-Jakey-vn

AndyWebsite was created by Andy Tran as part of the ETC5523 Assignment 4 project.

The purpose of this package is to extend previous analyses from Assignments 2 and 3 by using data from the BHAI package to build an interactive, user-friendly Shiny dashboard.

This dashboard allows users to explore healthcare-associated infection (HAI) data from the German PPS 2011 dataset, visualising infection prevalence and duration interactively.

The goal is to let users interact with the data to better understand the relationships and conclusions drawn from earlier analyses.
