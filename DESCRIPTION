    This package provides an integrated environment for data analysis and interactive exploration.
    It includes the cleaned dataset used in previous analyses, a collection of helper functions 
    for summarising and visualising results, and a Shiny web application that allows users to 
    interactively explore patterns in the data. The package also features full documentation 
    generated with roxygen2 and a pkgdown website for reproducibility and transparency.
